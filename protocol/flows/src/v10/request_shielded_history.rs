/// long as it liked. That was survivable while history serving was rare (it defaulted to
/// `--archival` only). It stops being survivable now that every node defaults to holding and
/// serving history, which is exactly the change that makes this path worth attacking.

/// A whole-chain backfill is ~116 round trips, so at this spacing an honest requester pays about

/// history below the pruning point is simply absent, and a wallet querying such a node sees a
/// silently partial balance. This flow serves that missing range to a requesting peer.
///
/// The walk happens here, not on the requester: a syncing node cannot enumerate the range
/// itself, because `init_with_pruning_point` numbers its selected-chain index from ITS OWN
/// pruning point as 0 (so index spaces do not align between nodes) and its header segment stops
/// far above genesis. The requester names an anchor block; this side walks its own selected
/// chain downward from there.
///
/// Serving needs only the selected-chain index and the scan archive, both of which survive
/// pruning, so a pruned node can serve full history it can no longer otherwise reach.
